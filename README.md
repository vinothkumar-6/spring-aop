# Spring Boot Core Hibernate JPA MVC AOP Thymeleaf Demo

## Overview

This Spring Boot project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of various key features and concepts in web development using Spring Boot. It covers the basics of Spring Boot, Spring Core, Hibernate with JPA, Spring MVC, Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), and Thymeleaf templating engine.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of Spring Boot development:

1. **01-spring-boot-overview**: Provides an overview of Spring Boot and its features.
2. **02-spring-boot-spring-core**: Covers the basics of Spring Core and dependency injection.
3. **03-spring-boot-hibernate-jpa-curd**: Demonstrates CRUD operations using Hibernate with JPA (Java Persistence API).
4. **04-spirng-rest-api-curd**: Illustrates building RESTful APIs with Spring Boot for CRUD operations.
5. **04-spring-boot-rest-curd**: Another module focusing on building RESTful APIs with Spring Boot.
6. **05-springboot-springMVC**: Explores Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture in Spring Boot.
7. **06-thymeleafdemo-springMVC**: Introduces Thymeleaf templating engine for server-side rendering in Spring MVC.
8. **07-springMVC-validationdemo**: Shows how to perform form validation in Spring MVC.
9. **08-spring-boot-spring-mvc-crud**: Focuses on building CRUD applications with Spring Boot MVC.
10. **09-spring-boot-aop**: Demonstrates Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in Spring Boot.
11. **10-spring-boot-mvc-crud-demo-employees**: Demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Spring Boot MVC.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd spring-boot-core-hibernate-jpa-mvc-aop-thymeleaf`

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies:

- **Spring Boot**: Provides a framework for building Spring-based applications with minimal configuration.
- **Hibernate with JPA**: Offers a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for interacting with databases.
- **Thymeleaf**: A modern server-side Java template engine for web and standalone environments.
- **Spring MVC**: A web framework built on top of the Spring Framework for building web applications.
- **AspectJ**: An aspect-oriented extension to the Java programming language, used for AOP.
